# Adaptive Bayesian Optimization for State-Dependent Brain Stimulation

Brain stimulation has become an important treatment option for a variety of neurological and psychiatric diseases. A key challenge in improving brain stimulation is selecting the optimal set of stimulation parameters for each patient, as parameter spaces are too large for brute-force search and their induced effects can exhibit complex subject-specific behavior. To achieve greatest effectiveness, stimulation parameters may additionally need to be adjusted based on an underlying neural state, which may be unknown, unmeasurable, or challenging to quantify a priori. In this study, we first develop a simulation of a state-dependent brain stimulation experiment using rodent optogenetic stimulation data. We then use this simulation to demonstrate and evaluate two implementations of an adaptive Bayesian optimization algorithm that can model a dynamically changing response to stimulation parameters without requiring knowledge of the underlying neural state.
